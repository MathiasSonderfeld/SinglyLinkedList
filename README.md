# SinglyLinkedList
A Singly Linked List for Java projects.
Implements Java.util.List and uses Java Generics.
This implementation is not synchronized.

**WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION**

### Integration
I recommend using Maven for the integration.
This list will be available there shortly.
Until then, build a jar with maven and install it in your local repository.
Then you can use it before its available.

### Usage
Use as any other List.
